# aimTrainerTracer
An alternate to my other aim trainer where you must follow the target with your mouse. Created the framework on my phone while at dinner with my cousin.

Easy is slow
Medium is faster
Hard is fastest with added flashes of red as distraction

Score is one per frame as long as the mouse is on the target
Time to reach 1000 points is displayed upon reaching 1000 points
